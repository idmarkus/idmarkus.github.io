<div class="text-inner"><h1 lang="en">>[...] a brief evo&#173;ca&#173;tion after one of sev&#173;eral field trips last win&#173;ter (in Tex&#173;as), part of a work&#173;shop on "Un&#173;der&#173;ground Spa&#173;tial&#173;i&#173;ties."< </h1>

<p lang="en">Early morn&#173;ing, water&#173;fall out&#173;side gath&#173;er&#173;ing point, the ship in the sky, made of blue steel, helio&#173;copter hov&#173;er&#173;ing next to the ship in the sky (Memo&#173;rial Hos&#173;pi&#173;tal). The engi&#173;neer thinks it has a cam&#173;era under&#173;neath its bel&#173;ly. The heli&#173;copter pho&#173;to&#173;graphs us from above. I get my cam&#173;era ready. </p>

<p lang="en">I crawl under the “Ex&#173;haust.” A beau&#173;ti&#173;ful abstract art&#173;work, a dou&#173;ble helix-&#173;like sculp&#173;ture appar&#173;ently built next to the con&#173;trol room of the plant, where the vent should have been.  No one prob&#173;a&#173;bly knows it is here. The exhaust was aban&#173;doned, a sculp&#173;ture put in its place. We go inside the plant and are greeted by the staff. Har&#173;vey, the engi&#173;neer, will be our guide. </p>

<p lang="en">He takes us into the Noise Room of the plant, and before enter&#173;ing, we pass by the ‘Gym of Bro&#173;ken Dream&#173;s.’ When I ask, Har&#173;vey explains he does not see any progress in his col&#173;leagues’ hard work&#173;out ses&#173;sions with the heavy weights. Thus the name. </p>

<p lang="en">Descend&#173;ing down the stairs into the Tun&#173;nels (un&#173;derneath Rice Uni&#173;ver&#173;sity cam&#173;pus in Hous&#173;ton), the noise from the plant tur&#173;bines is over&#173;whelm&#173;ing. No word can be heard. The group descends, one by one, down the stairs, I am the last, and soon have lost track, the group moves swiftly and I am left behind, in a way of course that was on pur&#173;pose so I could begin to feel alone and at home in the under ground tun&#173;nel with its left and right pipe&#173;lines.  Left: Steam. Right:  Chilled Water.  Or vice ver&#173;sa. There are also elec&#173;tri&#173;cal cables and, from the older recent days, net&#173;work fiber optics cables.  </p>

<p lang="en">Archae&#173;o&#173;log&#173;i&#173;cally speak&#173;ing, we move from new&#173;est tun&#173;nels (wider) to older tun&#173;nels (nar&#173;row&#173;er) to very old tun&#173;nels (very nar&#173;row) – built 10 years ago, 20 to 30 years ago, to 80 years ago.  Our move&#173;ment will per&#173;haps not reach the old&#173;est cor&#173;ri&#173;dors, as they are so tight and nar&#173;row and wet, and thus less pass&#173;able. Today we are not cavers, only tun&#173;nel walk&#173;ers. One might have to crawl on occa&#173;sion? Today we do not crawl, though we bend (un&#173;der) and climb (over) pipes. </p>

<p lang="en">Head&#173;ing into the labyrinth. As I have lost touch with the group, and can only hear faint noise of voices reced&#173;ing, I have to make guess&#173;es, go right, then left, then right again, then straight, back, and for&#173;ward again. </p>

<p lang="en">Tun&#173;nels are geo&#173;met&#173;ric. Lin&#173;ear. Straight&#173;for&#173;ward and unevent&#173;ful. The same, ad infini&#173;tum. Pipes on the left, pipes on the right, at some point, one reaches what the engi&#173;neers, strange&#173;ly, call the ‘Ball&#173;room.’ I see no dances (I will later try to cre&#173;ate one on in the the&#173;atre, using ice hockey as my move&#173;ment inspi&#173;ra&#173;tion, see pic on the right). But one has a lit&#173;tle space to turn, admire graf&#173;fiti and wall paint&#173;ings, and lis&#173;ten to the peri&#173;odic severe crack&#173;ling of con&#173;den&#173;sa&#173;tion as it gets “trapped” in a trap. </p>

<p lang="en">Trap&#173;ping noise – this is the most beau&#173;ti&#173;ful sen&#173;sa&#173;tion I imag&#173;ine hear&#173;ing, crackle music, sonic dis&#173;tor&#173;tion, cracked media. Over the last decades, artists and musi&#173;cians manip&#173;u&#173;lat&#173;ed, cracked, and broke audio media tech&#173;nolo&#173;gies to pro&#173;duce such cracked sounds in per&#173;for&#173;mances. Here, the tun&#173;nels offer quite casu&#173;ally such an extended sound palet&#173;te, includ&#173;ing tiny trick&#173;les, whis&#173;pers of water drops, and scratch&#173;es, as one looks and looks and does not see much (apart from one long cor&#173;ri&#173;dor where stu&#173;dent invaders have left their scrib&#173;blings and cave paint&#173;ings. Char&#173;lie was here. Tommy loves Ryan. Fuck every&#173;thing. I miss Han&#173;nah. You know noth&#173;ing.  </p>

<p lang="en">Water and steam and elec&#173;tri&#173;cal grid are run&#173;ning there, as I walk up and down aim&#173;less&#173;ly. Valves draw atten&#173;tion, sand and dirt on the HVAC pip&#173;ing, some older  rusty metal pipes are wet, as if sweat&#173;ing. The floor is con&#173;crete, some holes in the ceil&#173;ing mean they are man&#173;holes to pro&#173;vide exit to the above. Below: The hydronic sys&#173;tems (both chilled and heat&#173;ing water) are closed-loop sys&#173;tems, mean&#173;ing, I gath&#173;er, that the total dynamic head of the pumps takes into account the fric&#173;tion losses within the pip&#173;ing sys&#173;tem, asso&#173;ci&#173;ated coils, valves, and acces&#173;sories… </p>

<p lang="en">I end up try&#173;ing to wait patiently for qui&#173;et, and then the sound: record&#173;ing the ticks, pops, and clicks of the glitches of this hydronic under&#173;ground sys&#173;tem, the tun&#173;nel only there to pro&#173;vide its safe oper&#173;a&#173;tion for the 20m dol&#173;lar annual util&#173;i&#173;ties bud&#173;get, using 250 mil&#173;lion gal&#173;lons of domes&#173;tic water for the ser&#173;vic&#173;ing of the uni&#173;ver&#173;sity above the under ground. I also wait patiently for Har&#173;vey to turn off the elec&#173;tric lights in the long cor&#173;ri&#173;dor where I wait at the end, want&#173;ing to walk in the dark. Final&#173;ly, I see him at the far end, switch&#173;ing off the last light. I am alone in the dark now, able to lis&#173;ten with&#173;out dis&#173;trac&#173;tion. </p>
