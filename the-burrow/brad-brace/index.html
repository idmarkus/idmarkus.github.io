You begin to sense the byshadows that stretch from the awe of global
dominance. How the intersecting systems help pull us apart, leaving us
vague, drained, docile, soft in our inner discourse, willing to be
shaped, to be overwhelmed -- easy retreats, half beliefs. Works of art
are complex formal interventions within discursive traditions and their
myriad filiations. These interventions are defined precisely by their
incomparable capacity to trace the dynamics of historical process in
paradoxical gestures of simultaneously prognostic and mnemonic
temporalities. | __|   | | | (_) | |  __/ (__| |_ _  | |  | '_ \ / _ \

>>>> Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from { brad
brace }. The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the
recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history. This
discourse, far from determining the locus in which it speaks, is
avoiding the ground on which it could find support. It is trying to
operate a decentering that leaves no privilege to any center.


The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project ----------------------------- began
December 30, 1994


Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of imagery... 
genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact, collectable and
compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey imminence: the
art of making the other disappear. Continual visual impact; an optical
drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present of the Net.

An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and
re-sequenced over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The
12hr dialtone...

~ Mirror-sites requested! Archives too! The latest new jpeg will always
be named, 12hr.jpeg Average size of images is only 45K. * Perl program
to mirror ftp-sites/sub-directories: src.doc.ic.ac.uk:/packages/mirror *

~ Postings to usenet newsgroups: 12hr alt.12hr

alt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.misc

* * Ask your system's news-administrator to carry these groups! (There
are also usenet image browsers: TIFNY, PluckIt, Picture Agent,
PictureView, Extractor97, NewsRover, Binary News Assistant, EasyNews,
Awasu, Bloglines, FeedReader, InfoSnorkel, NetNewsWire, NewsIsFree, 
NewzCrawler, SharpReader, Usenet Binaries)

~ This interminable, relentless (online) sequence of imagery began in
earnest on December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has
been over twenty-five years in the making. While the specific sequence
of photographs has been presently orchestrated for many years` worth of
12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour image
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation.

~ The sites listed above also contain information on other cultural
projects and sources.

~ A very low-volume, moderated mailing list for announcements and
occasional commentary related to this project has been established at
topica.com /subscribe 12hr-project

-- The image was to make nothing visible but their connection with one
another by space and air, yet each surrounded by the unique aura that
disengages every deeply seen image from the world of irrelevant
relationships and calls forth a tremor of astonishment at its fateful
necessity. Thus from artworks of dead masters, over-life-size
strangeness whose names we do not know and do not wish to know, look out
at us enigmatically as symbols of all being.

--

Big Grey Bricks: This project also serves as a rehearsal for its
culmination as a series of offset-printed volumes: each 800+ full-bleed
pages (5x8"_300lpi), where the full integrated rhythm of
greyscale-sequence can be more intricately resolved. I'd provide all
design, prepress and production.

-- This project has not received government art-subsidies. Some
opportunities still exist for financially assisting the publication of
editions of large (33x46") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) inkjet
duotones or extended-black quadtones. Other supporters receive rare
copies of the first three web-offset printed ISBN-Books. Contributions
and requests for 12hr-email-subscriptions, can also be made at
http://bbrace.laughingsquid.net/buy-into.html, or by mailed
cheque/check: $5/mo $50/yr. Art-institutions must pay for any images
retained longer than 12 hours.
