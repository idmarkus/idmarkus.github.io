The busiest bastions, inseparable institutions and enduring endeavours—the bigger and better we commit to engorge for our own fulfillment and livelihood—are forests not seen for their trees. To grow tall they root deep.

Inspired by aardvarks, who dig to escape when attacked rather than lashing, and will leave their burrows for others to use when relocating. The aardvark reminds us to think with our claws. No one expects us to dig when they force us to move; still in compliance but keeping our place. Then, we can tickle the feet of our oppressors as they try to pass.

Here beneath the earth, where places of refuge coincide with the secret bases of those who must be hidden from, we invite the secluded to berate the reclusive. In tunnels and caverns we comfort the hidden and deride the veiled; listen to those who must never speak, look for things we have lost and spy on the spies spying on us.
      
First conceived as a secondary space of the Very Large Works pavilion, a strange loop gallery-in-gallery. A latent expanse the Burrow would root to sprout on its own, forming two distinct inseparate spaces. Mushrooms on either end of the same forest, sharing mycelium.
